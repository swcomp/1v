INSTRUCTIONS FOR UPDATING ALL THE PROJECT FILES TO INCLUDE THE PRE-BUILD ASSEMBLY_INFO UPDATE HOOK
  
 
STEPS - To add all pre-existing projects in a repo to automated assembly versioning:

1) Install AstroGrep and configure Notepad++ as the default text editor.
1) Using AstroGrep Search repo folder tree for all project files ( *.csproj, *.vbproj )
2) Select all found files and open. ( Notepad++ will open all files at once ).
3) 	a)Search for :   "  <!-- To modify your build process" and confirm found in files same number as AstroGrep search result, may be slightly less.
	b) Scroll through the Notepad++ search results and make sure there is only one 'hit' per file.
4) Ctl+F to Replace in all open documents:
	> Toggle "Extended ..." Search Mode ( bottom left of Replace dialog )
	> Find expression: ( copy to left margin to get leading spaces for correct project file indent ):
  <!-- To modify your build process
	> Find expression ( copy to left margin to get leading spaces for correct project file indent ):
  <PropertyGroup>\n    <PreBuildEvent>1v "$(MSBuildProjectDirectory)" $(MSBuildProjectExtension)</PreBuildEvent>\n  </PropertyGroup>\n    <!-- To modify your build process
5) 	a) Replace in all open documents. ( take a note of number of replacements )
	b) Ctl+Shift+S ( or click SaveAll ) > the red disk icons for each file will turn blue.
6) Check for modifications in SVN to confirm all files saved ok.
7) Close all files in Notepad++
8) Close AstroGrep search and repeat, then order files by Date Modified ASC and the missed files ( without  MSBUILD Targets code ) will be listed at the top.
9) Select just the missed files and open them.
10) Manually add the following PreBuildEvent element just before the closing project element ( copy to the left margin to get correct indent ):
  <PropertyGroup>
    <PreBuildEvent>1v "$(MSBuildProjectDirectory)" $(MSBuildProjectExtension)</PreBuildEvent>
  </PropertyGroup>
11) Commit the changed files to SVN.
12) Get the latest repo root TestApp_ProductVersionRoot.xml file from SVN.
13) Build ALL repo projects.
14) Commit the changed files ( AssemblyInfo.cs, AssemblyInfo.vb and any dlls and exes ) to SVN, these will all now have the correct version number.
